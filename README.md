Manage your Git File and Commit Message Workflows with Changelists!

## Introduction
Changelist-Init is a command-line tool that uses `git` to obtain file data and insert it into your changelists!

Changelist-Init is the package that gets your changelists started, and keeps them up to date with the newest file changes in your repository.

The package `changelist-sort` is for organizing the files in your Changelists.

The package `changelist-foci` (File Oriented Commit Information) prints commit messages for your Changelists.
